# LLMUserEncoder

This is a part of ReSys research aimed at calculating user's embeddings based on their interactions with items using LLM capability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLMUserEncoder.git
    cd LLMUserEncoder
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Preparing the Dataset

Ensure that your dataset is placed in the folder `data/ml-1m` for MovieLense or `data/Amazon_CDs_and_Vinyl` for Amazon Musics. 

### Add OpanAI API key

To use the OpenAI API, you need to add your API key to the `token.yaml` file. 
You can find the `token.yaml` file in the root directory of the project. Add your API key to the file as shown below:

```yaml
openai: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Running the Script

To evaluate embeddings for users in the dataset, run the `encode.py` script with the following command:

```sh
python encode.py --folder <path_to_dataset_folder> --agent <agent_name> --result-folder <path_to_result_folder> [--test]
```
### Arguments

- `--dataset` or `-d`: Type of dataset to be used, supports `ml-1m` for MovieLense and `amazon` for Amazon CD's and Vinyl.
- `--agent` or `-a`: The agent for the LLM model. Only `openai` is supported. Default is `openai`.
- `--result-folder` or `-r`: The folder for the results JSON. Default is `embeddings`.
- `--test` or `-t`: Test mode. Only generate descriptions without LLM calls.

### Example

```sh
python encode.py --dataset ml-1m --agent openai --result-folder embeddings --test
```

This command will process the dataset in `data/ml-1m`, use the `openai` agent, and save the results in the `embeddings` folder. The `--test` flag indicates that only descriptions will be generated without making LLM calls (prompt will be used).

### Output

The script will generate two JSON files in the specified result folder:

- `{mode}_description.json`: Contains the user descriptions and embeddings.
- `{mode}_errors.json`: Contains any errors that occurred during processing.

#### `{mode}_description.json` Schema

The `{mode}_description.json` file contains an array of user objects. Each user object of ml-1m has the following structure:

- `id` (int): The unique identifier for the user.
- `gender` (str): User's gender according to original dataset
- `age` (int): User's age category according to original dataset
- `rankings` (list[dict[str, int]]): List of dictionaries containing the item ID and rating given by the user.
- `description` (str): The description of the user generated by the LLM.
- `embedding` (list[float], optional): The embedding vector for the user description. This field is empty if the `--test` flag is not used.
- `prompt` (str): The prompt used to generate the user description.'

**Note:** Fields `age` and `gender` are optional and presented only for the MovieLense dataset.
